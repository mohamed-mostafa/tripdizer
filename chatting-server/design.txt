design:
	map of agents sockets
	map of users sockets
	map of ongoing conversations
	service to retrieve list of agents

	once an agents clicks on -i'm ready- button
		its opens a socket to the server and is saved on the server side in the agents sockets

	once a user opens the chat window (a modal)
		the window requests his name
		it shows him if there're agents online or not

	once a user sends a message 
		it opens a socket to the server and is saved on the server side in the users sockets
		we locate an empty agent and we put both sessions in the ongoing conversations map
		we send the message to the agent
		the agent's browser opens a new window - this is the only way an agent can talk to a user

	once an agent closes the chat window (or clicks the close chat window button)
		we remove him from agents sockets
		we find if there're ongoing conversations, and notify the other party
		we remove the record from the ongoing conversations	

	when a user is disconnected
		we remove him from agents sockets
		we remove him from users sockets
		we remove him from ongoing conversations socket, and send a message to the other party
